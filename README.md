# JC Database PHP experiment

Since the 1970s, he has had numerous roles in the film industry including writer, actor, composer, producer, and director. 
After directing Dark Star (1974), he has helmed both classic horror films like Halloween (1978), 
The Fog (1980), and The Thing (1982), and noted sci-fi tales like Escape from New York (1981) and Starman (1984).

So obviously I wanted to build an amazing database for his movies.
